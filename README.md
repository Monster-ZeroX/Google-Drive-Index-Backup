`Note: The Changes in your workers config can effect later due to cache. Use incognito mode everytime to open the worker URL to overcome that issue.`

## Project Website

* [gdi.js.org](https://gdi.js.org) by [js.org](https://js.org)

## Demo Site

* [snowy.connectvip.workers.dev/](https://snowy.connectvip.workers.dev/)

## How to

* Stable Release `2.0.18` on bhadoo.mirrorleech.workers.dev
* Beta Version (Latest) - [bhadoo.mirrorleech.workers.dev](https://bhadoo.mirrorleech.workers.dev) (Dark Theme Available)
* If you want to deploy main drive leave the option ROOT as it is.
* If you want to deploy your Team Drive/Shared Drive/Folder then copy the ID and replace it with ROOT.
* Eg. if you open this shared drive `https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/0AOM2i7MQiuWIUk9PVA` - `0AOM2i7MQiuWIUk9PVA` is its ID.
* Authenticate and copy the code from Google and paste it into Authorization Code Box.
* Click on Get Code to Generate Code and Copy it for later use.
* Now Create Cloudflare account and verify email or login with existing account.
* Find Workers and Open it.
* Create your sub-domain or continue if already done.
* Select the Free Plan.
* Click on Create a Worker.
* You can rename the workers at top of the page.
* Now paste the code you copied before.
* Click on Save and Deploy.
* Done. (May take time for some users due to new account or cache issues)

## Basic Config

````
    "roots":[
      {
          "id": "root",
          "name": "Drive One",
          "protect_file_link": false,
         // "auth": {"username":"password"} /* Remove double slash before "auth" to activate id password protection */
      },
    ]};
````

## Multiple ID Config

* Add this code for each drive. see cloudflare workers code for more info. (requires common sense)

````
    "roots":[
      {
          "id": "root",
          "name": "Drive One",
          "protect_file_link": false,
         // "auth": {"username":"password"} /* Remove double slash before "auth" to activate id password protection */
      },
      {
          "id": "root",
          "name": "Drive Two",
          "protect_file_link": false,
         // "auth": {"username":"password", "username1":"password1"} /* Remove double slash before "auth" to activate id password protection */
      },
    ]};
````

## Service Account

* Multiple Service Accounts are supported.
* set `"service_account": false` to `"service_account": true`
* Replace {} with data from service account `file.json`

## Multiple Users Password

* For single user

````
            // "auth": {"username":"password"} /** remove double slash at starting of this line to use password. */
````

* For multiple users (unlimited users)

````
      {
          "id": "",
          "name": "Drive Two",
          "protect_file_link": false,
          // "auth": { "user1":"pass1", "user2":"pass2", }  /** remove double slash at starting of this line to use password. */
      },
````

* where `"user1":"pass1"` and `"user2":"pass2"` are combinations.
* if users adds `"auth":{"":""}` empty values then the site will ask for authentication but user can enter without entering any data by clicking submit.

## Use of .password File

* This is directory encryption added by the original author.
* Add a .password file your required password in your folder which you want to protect, each folder should have its own .password file.
* The password is stored inside the Google Drive Folder, not the index and the .password file is hidden an cannot be accessed using Index.
* Example use https://bit.ly/3tBxXJN and password is `thispassword`

## Brand Customization

* In Latest Release, you can rebrand the Index as per your needs.
* Each line has its own custom feature. Edit as per your needs.
* You can remove credit option but we request you not to.
* See Below code to understand Customization.

## arc.io Integration

* arc.io is embedded in code to support gdi.js.org
* if you have approved arc.io account, use your code.
* incase you don't have arc account and want to support us, please keep our arc.io code in your index.
* if anyone doesn't want to support us and want to remove arc, remove [this](https://github.com/AmirulAndalib/Google-Drive-Index/blob/master/worker/worker-beta.js#L133) line from workers code.

## Themes

* There are 25 Themes from [bootswatch](https://github.com/thomaspark/bootswatch) official [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com) Themes.
* You can check Theme from [bootswatch.com](https://bootswatch.com) before selecting.
* To Change theme, first generate the code, paste in Cloudflare Workers and then select one theme code from below and paste it in line 56 of worker script.

| Themes    |         |         |         |        |          |
|-----------|---------|---------|---------|--------|----------|
| cerulean  | cosmo   | cyborg  | darkly  | flatly | journal  |
| litera    | lumen   | lux     | materia | minty  | pulse    |
| sandstone | simplex | sketchy | slate   | solar  | spacelab |
| superhero | united  | yeti    | vapor   | morph  | quartz   |    
| zephyr    |

## Audio and Video

* Poster for Video is added as default.
* Fetch Video Poster from Google Drive, uses default if none available.

## Search Limitations

* Search only works if you use Shared Drive ID or root.
* Search won't work or the bar won't appear if you're using Folder ID inside from root or Shared Drive.

## Sorting by Name or Modified Time

* Find `params.orderBy` in workers code L623 and L710.
* use `params.orderBy = 'folder,name,modifiedTime desc';` to sort by File and Folder Name.
* use `params.orderBy = 'folder,modifiedTime desc,name';` to sort by Modified Time.
* A comma-separated list of sort keys. Valid keys are 'createdTime', 'folder', 'modifiedByMeTime', 'modifiedTime', 'name', 'name_natural', 'quotaBytesUsed', 'recency', 'sharedWithMeTime', 'starred', and 'viewedByMeTime'. Each key sorts ascending by default, but may be reversed with the 'desc' modifier. Example usage: ?orderBy=folder,modifiedTime desc,name. Please note that there is a current limitation for users with approximately one million files in which the requested sort order is ignored.

## Making your own repo, editing and making changes

* Fork this Repo or Import.
* Make your changes in `app.js` and `workers-beta.js` files.
